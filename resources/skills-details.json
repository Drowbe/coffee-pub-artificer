      "description": "<p><strong>Masonry</strong> is the craft of shaping, fitting, and assembling stone for structural and decorative purposes. It governs quarrying, cutting, carving, and joining stone to produce durable constructions and precise stone components.</p><p>It encompasses three primary areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Stone Selection &amp; Assessment:</strong> Identifying suitable stone types; recognizing fractures and weaknesses; judging structural integrity; and selecting material appropriate to load, environment, and purpose.</li><li><strong>Cutting &amp; Shaping:</strong> Splitting, chiseling, smoothing, and carving stone to precise dimensions; creating interlocking forms; and producing fitted blocks, panels, and structural elements.</li><li><strong>Assembly &amp; Reinforcement:</strong> Laying stone with proper alignment and support; applying mortar or dry-fit techniques; reinforcing stress points; and ensuring long-term stability.</li></ul><p>Masonry supports the construction of walls, foundations, statues, structural components, and fitted stonework. It focuses on durability, precision, and load-bearing integrity rather than mineral extraction or metal forging.</p>",
